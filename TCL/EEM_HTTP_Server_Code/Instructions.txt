- Decide where you want to save those files on your router flash
- Copy the included files to that flash directory
  - Please note that I hard-coded that directory in http_server.tcl to "disk2:/", you need to change it
- Enter the following commands
  Config t
    event manager directory user policy "disk2:/"     (replace disk2:/ with your flash directory)
	event manager policy http_server.tcl
	end
  event manager run http_server.tcl
- Note that if you have the IOS HTTP server feature enabled in your router, the script will fail
- Open a browser
- In the address field, enter your router IP address.
- You should see your page.

File type supported:
- .htm and .html					Standrd HTML pages
- .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .ico, .png		Image files
- .tcl								Script files
  The script will run and it can wtite back to the client browser using the "puts command"
  Example:

puts "HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary

<html>
  ...
</html>"
